# Grades-Web-App
A Grade Web Application that allows a user to ask for a grade from a SQL database and display the grade, given the studentâ€™s name. It also allows the user to see all students and grades in the database and create a new student name and grade while editing the grade.

To run this file, create a folder and name it whather. Put the app.py inside that folder. Include two more folders inside this folder and name them staic and templates. Script.js and style.css should be in the static folder, while grades.html should be in templates.

Example for your workspace:
gradesApp
--app.py
--static
  ||script.js
  ||style.css
--templates
  ||grades.html
